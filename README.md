# My-Zomato-Data-Analysis-Project
📌 Overview
This project analyzes Zomato restaurant data to uncover key trends in customer preferences, ratings, order types (online/offline), and spending habits. Using Python in Jupyter Notebook, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualized insights using various charts (bar, line, histogram, boxplot, heatmap, and sns.countplot).

## 📊 Visualizations

To support the analysis, several types of visualizations were used:

- `Bar Charts` – to show vote distributions across restaurant types
- `Histograms` – to understand the cost and rating distributions
- `Line Charts` – to visualize trends over time (if time-based data available)
- `Boxplots` – to study cost and rating outliers
- `Heatmaps` – to detect correlations between features
- `Countplots` – to display categorical distributions
## 📌 Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Zomato dataset to answer the following business questions:

1. **What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?**  
   🔍 *Conclusion: Most restaurants fall in the dining category.*

2. **How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?**  
   🔍 *Conclusion: Dining restaurants have received the maximum votes.*

3. **What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?**  
   🔍 *Conclusion: Most restaurants received ratings between 3.5 to 4.*

4. **What is the average spending per order by couples ordering online?**  
   🔍 *Conclusion: Couples prefer restaurants with an approximate cost of ₹300 per order.*

5. **Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?**  
   🔍 *Conclusion: Online orders have received higher ratings compared to offline orders.*

6. **Which type of restaurant received more offline orders?**  
   🔍 *Conclusion: Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, while cafes primarily receive online orders.*
